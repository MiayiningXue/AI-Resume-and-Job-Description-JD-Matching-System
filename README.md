# AI-Resume-and-Job-Description-JD-Matching-System

In this project, I developed an AI-powered resume and job description (JD) matching system using both the TF-IDF and BERT methods.

- **TF-IDF Method**: Calculates similarity scores based on word frequency and shared vocabulary across the dataset. It performs well when exact keyword matching is important.
- **BERT Method**: The BERT model is a pre-trained model developed by Google.
Transforms resumes and JDs into semantic embeddings using pre-trained language models. This approach captures the actual meaning of the text, allowing for more context-aware and intelligent matching.

The results of the two methods vary significantly, offering different perspectives on candidate relevance. This comparison can provide valuable insights for recruiters when filtering and prioritizing resumes from a large candidate pool.
